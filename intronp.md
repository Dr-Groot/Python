NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.

**HISTORY:** Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many contributors to this open source project.

> NumPy stands for **Numerical Python**.

## Why NumPy?

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. Lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
