NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.

**HISTORY:** Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many contributors to this open source project.

> NumPy stands for **Numerical Python**.

## Why NumPy?

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. Lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

The array object in NumPy is called **ndarray**, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

## Why NumPy is Faster?

NumPy arrays are stored at one **continuous place in memory unlike lists**, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. This behavior is called **locality** of reference in computer science.

This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.

> NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

## USE

Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations −
+ Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
+ Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.
+ Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

## NumPy - A Replacement for MATLAB

NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy (Scientific Python) and Mat−plotlib (plotting library). This combination is widely used as a replacement for MatLab, a popular platform for technical computing. However, Python alternative to MatLab is now seen as a more modern and complete programming language.

> It is open source, which is an added advantage of NumPy.
