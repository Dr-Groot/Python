# GETTING STARTED WITH ENVIRONMENT

Standard Python distribution doesn't come bundled with NumPy module. A lightweight alternative is to install NumPy using popular Python package installer, pip.

In terminal:
```
pip install numpy
```

In anaconda:
```
conda install numpy
```

If already have check version using __version__ attribute:
```python
print(numpy.__version__)
```


Upgrading NumPy:
```
pip install --upgrade numpy
```
